      <h3><b>*HISTORY*</b></h3>
      <p>
        The National Museum, New Delhi, as we see it today, has an interesting
        beginning. The blueprint for establishing the National Museum in Delhi
        was prepared by the Maurice Gwyer Committee in May 1946. An Exhibition
        of Indian Art, consisting of selected artefacts from various museums of
        India was organized by the Royal Academy, London with the cooperation of
        Government of India and Britain. The Exhibition went on display in the
        galleries of Burlington House, London during the winter months of
        1947-48. It was decided to display the same collection in Delhi, before
        the return of exhibits to their respective museums. An exhibition was
        organized in the the RashtrapatiBhawan (President's residence), New
        Delhi in 1949, which turned out to be a great success. This event proved
        responsible for the creation of the National Museum.
      </p>
      <p>
        On August 15, 1949, the National Museum, New Delhi, was inaugurated in
        the Rashtrapati Bhawan by Shri R.C. Rajagopalachari, the
        Governor-General of India. The foundation of the present building was
        laid by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, on May 12,
        1955. The first phase of the National Museumbuilding was formally
        inaugurated by Dr. SarvepalliRadhakrishnan, the Vice President of India,
        on December 18, 1960. The second phase of the building was completed in
        1989.
        <br />
        While the Museum continued to grow its collection through gifts that
        were sought painstakingly, artefacts were collected through its Arts
        Purchase Committee. The Museum presently holds approximately 2,00,000
        objects of diverse nature, both Indian as well as foreign, and its
        holdings cover a time span of more than five thousand years of Indian
        cultural heritage.
